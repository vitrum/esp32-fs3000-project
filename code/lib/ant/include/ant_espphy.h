/*
 * ant_espphy.h - ANT on the ESP32's own 2.4 GHz radio (the pure-ESP32 PHY).
 *
 * Implements ant_phy_t on the BLE controller of an ESP32-S3 / ESP32-C3 with no
 * external chip. The trick (from ESPwn32 / esperanto, Cayre et al., WOOT 2023)
 * is that the RW-BLE link-layer core is a generic GFSK modem whose per-event
 * control structure (CS) lives in a RAM the CPU can write, and whose
 * link-layer functions are called through a writable table (r_ip_funcs_p).
 * We run the controller's own LE test mode (DTM, "channel 39") and hook two
 * of its functions: after the controller has programmed the test event we
 * rewrite the CS so the modem runs at 1 Mbit/s on 2457 MHz with the ANT sync
 * word and CRC/whitening off, and in the RX interrupt we lift the raw bytes
 * out of the RX descriptor. That is exactly ANT's ShockBurst air format, so
 * the ANT MAC (ant_mac) runs unchanged on top.
 *
 *   RX  : HCI LE receiver test. The event never ends, the evt_start hook
 *         reprograms the CS, the rx_isr hook hands every packet that matched
 *         the sync word to a lock-free ring for rx_poll(). Test mode runs with
 *         whitening off, so the bytes only need bit-reversal. The sync word is
 *         chosen from the MAC's address match: a known device number gives
 *         `a6 c5 dev_hi dev_lo`, a wildcard search gives `aa aa a6 c5`
 *         (preamble + network marker), and the rest of the address is matched
 *         in software - which is what lets several slave channels share the
 *         one receiver. Wildcard caveat: the core reads the byte after the
 *         sync word as a length, so ~5% of device numbers (those whose low
 *         byte bit-reverses to < 13) cannot be found by wildcard search;
 *         give the device number explicitly for those.
 *   TX  : HCI LE transmitter test; tx() drops the frame into the DTM payload
 *         buffer, so the next test packet carries it, and clears it again a
 *         few ms later. DTM transmits back-to-back, so the frame goes out a
 *         few times per slot; receivers ignore the repeats.
 *
 * The controller runs one test event at a time and switching takes
 * milliseconds of HCI traffic, so the backend is "sticky": rx_enable(true)
 * puts it in RX mode (a slave/display), the first tx() puts it in TX mode (a
 * master/sensor). Once in a mode the other direction is refused and counted.
 * A bidirectional master therefore transmits but never hears replies; the ANT
 * MAC copes (broadcasts do not need one).
 *
 * In the default (exclusive) mode the controller is used bare (no BLE host,
 * our own VHCI callback), so a BLE host cannot be up at the same time: init()
 * refuses unless the controller is idle, deinit() shuts it down again for the
 * host.
 *
 * There is also a coexist (shared-radio) mode - ant_espphy_init_coexist() -
 * that runs ANT receive *alongside* a live BLE host (NimBLE/Bluedroid) instead
 * of taking the controller. It hooks the controller's scan path rather than
 * test mode: while an ANT receive is open, the BLE host's passive-scan radio
 * windows are retuned to ANT, frames are lifted out, and the never-whitened
 * ANT payload is de-whitened in software - so no global radio register is
 * changed and BLE connection events between the scan windows keep working.
 * The scan windows are consumed by ANT (so BLE scanning pauses while an ANT
 * receive is open), and this mode is receive-only. See that function.
 *
 * Supported: ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3 (same controller; the function-table indices
 * are identical on ESP-IDF 4.4 and 5.x, so the Arduino core works too).
 * ESP32-C6 (a different controller) returns ANT_ESPPHY_ERR_UNSUPPORTED from
 * init for now.
